# Overview

This is the place where I'm working on python programming exercises.


In [simple_programming_problems](./simple_programming_problems) are living some solutions of Adrian Neumann's [Simple programming problems](simple_programming_problems).

In [programming_practice_problems](./programming_practice_problems) are living some solutions of Dr. John Dalbey's [Programming Practice Problems](http://users.csc.calpoly.edu/~jdalbey/103/Projects/ProgrammingPractice.html).

## How to use it

Prepare environment:

```
make env_ok
```

Format and type checking:
```
